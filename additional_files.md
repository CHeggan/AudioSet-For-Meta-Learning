Possible additional files::

Already Made(essentially):
- data scaling script for full set
- dataset classes 
- raw to .npy script 
- .npy to spectrogram
- Stat recorder
- Normalisation per channel and global

New files:
- meta splitting function(should be new version which actually changes raw file directories)
- combine all class dataframes into one that can be reloaded from (might have to add timings etc in meta data output). This should hopefully work with feeding back into the main script
